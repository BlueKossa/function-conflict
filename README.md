# Function Conflict
Toy game to test and develop my networking, math and graphics programming skills.

The game is basically just a ripoff of [Graphwar](https://github.com/catabriga/graphwar), a multiplayer game where you plot graphs to hit the enemy player(s).
## SDL2
I am using SDL for the graphics, so if you want to compile the program follow the [guide](https://github.com/Rust-SDL2/rust-sdl2) for your respecitve operating system. I might set up some action later on.
